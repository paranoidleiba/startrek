This is the beginning of the development of a small amateur text flight simulator for the NCC1701 ship in the terminal. So far implemented: checking systems, choosing a destination, simulating flight on a warp engine, exiting warp. Further development of the project is expected in the spirit of completing various missions, meeting with enemy ships (they should be displayed as) ascii objects, and stuff like that. I invite everyone to join the project.
The main file for launching start.py, then when flying at warp speed, varp.py is included

Last changes:
-improved exit from warp by timer
-stopping pulse motors by timer
-when choosing Planet Romulus, you encounter the ship "Romulan Warbird" and choose whether to fight or flee
